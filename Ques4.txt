Q)4 What is Django URLs?make program to create django urls.

Ans) In Django, a URL is a unique string that represents a specific resource or action on a web application. URLs are used to route users to the 
appropriate content or functionality when they visit a web application.

In Django, URLs are patterns used to map URLs to views within a web application. The URL patterns are defined in the urls.py module of each Django app, 
and they determine which view function or class-based view should be called for a given URL.

urls.py file:
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
path('', views.index, name='index'),
path('about/', views.about, name='about'),
path('contact/', views.contact, name='contact'),
]

Q3) Explain what does django-admin.py make messages command is used for?

Ans) The make_messages command scans your Django project for text strings marked for translation in your code and creates or updates message files for
different languages. 
These message files contain the original text strings and placeholders, and they serve as templates for translators to provide translations.

The make_messages command in Django is a management utility that automates the creation of translation files. It searches through the codebase for
instances of the {% trans %} template tag and generates a message file for each specified language. These files are then used to provide translations of 
the marked strings.
